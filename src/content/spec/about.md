# About

I am Farhan Ali Raza from Pakistan. I am a software engineer by profession. From a young age, I have loved building things from scratch, so I have turned my passion into my source of living. Nowadays, I mostly freelance and build small SAAS web applications. I have over four years of experience in building with Python (Django, Fast API) and NodeJS(Next, Sveltekit). I also like to make open-source contributions in my free time.
